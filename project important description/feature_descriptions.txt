### Notes on Artifacts
- **Raw Data CSV (`pakistan_crime_data.csv`)**:
  - Contains 300 records for hypothetical Pakistani neighborhoods.
  - Includes messy data: outliers (e.g., 1000 crimes/month), missing values (e.g., empty cells, "NA"), inconsistent formats (e.g., "2.5 km" vs. "2.5"), and mixed numeric/string values (e.g., "High" for Ethnic Diversity).
  - Designed for data cleaning practice, requiring handling of units, missing values, outliers, and format standardization.
  - Reflects Pakistan’s urban context (e.g., high population density in Karachi-like areas, low alcohol outlet density due to cultural norms).
  - Data cleaning tasks include:
    - Removing or imputing missing values (e.g., "NA", empty cells).
    - Standardizing units (e.g., stripping "km" or "%" from numeric fields).
    - Converting strings to numbers (e.g., "High" to a numeric index).
    - Detecting and handling outliers (e.g., 1000000 PKR income).
    - Ensuring age group ratios sum to 100%.
- **Feature Descriptions (`feature_descriptions.txt`)**:
  - Lists all 24 features (21 main features, with Age Group Ratios as three sub-features, plus the target).
  - Provides data type, format, relevance, potential correlation, and data quality issues.
  - Useful for understanding each feature’s role and preparing for data cleaning and analysis.

### Data Cleaning Practice
To become a proficient data scientist, you can use this dataset to practice:
1. **Handling Missing Values**: Impute (e.g., mean/median) or remove rows with "NA", "NULL", or empty cells.
2. **Standardizing Formats**: Strip units (e.g., "km", "%") and convert strings (e.g., "eight" to 8) using Python (e.g., `pandas`, `regex`).
3. **Outlier Detection**: Identify and cap/remove outliers (e.g., 1000 crimes/month) using IQR or z-scores.
4. **Type Conversion**: Convert mixed numeric/string fields (e.g., Ethnic Diversity "High" to a numeric index) using mappings or calculations.
5. **Validation**: Ensure age group ratios sum to 100% and remove invalid values (e.g., negative counts).
6. **Feature Engineering**: Derive clean numeric features (e.g
